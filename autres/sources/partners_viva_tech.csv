FLOATING GENES,"Floating Genes develops in vitro diagnostic kits for the early detection and monitoring of cancers in liquid biopsies (blood samples). Its technology allows highly sensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA by high-throughput sequencing (Next Generation Sequencing or NGS) at low sequencing depth. It is based on the selective amplification of mutant DNA and the correction of sequencing biais. Detecting actionable mutations can increase cancer survival by a factor of 9, helping clinicians identify cancer cases, guiding them in their treatment choices, and increasing survival by detecting relapses earlier. The company focuses on pancreatic cancer (PDAC), which kills 15,000 patients in France each year and has a median survival of 4 months.

However, Si has hardly been used because it has a large irreversible capacity, and a large volume change due to a charge/discharge reaction. ORLIB has developed the pressurized pre-doping technology to reduce irreversible capacity and the volume changes. Pre-doped Si, pSi, can be combined with various LIB cathodes to increase the energy by more than 1.5 times, making it possible to create high-energy batteries with low cost and rare metal-free LFP comparable to high energy LMNC.

SOUNDUCT,"1,5 billion people worldwide suffer from hearing loss: 428 millions are disabled and need an equipment. Yet, 83% of them are not fitted with hearing solutions.

In the face of this, conventional hearing aids are still based on the outdated principle of the ear trumpet: amplifying sound in a dysfunctional ear. Other solutions are invasive and expensive. In this context, the Sounduct device shifts the paradigm of deafness.

TECHKARE,"TECHKARE is an industrial startup working for good health at work. Supplying innovative solutions to move heavy rolling loads, such as hospital beds or trolleys without any effort, TECHKARE prevents musculoskeletal disorders and optimizes your productivity. Our first market is the hospital, and the next one will be the logistic.Our solution is an electrified removable device that the strecher plugs under the bed. He thus has just to push/pull the bed as usual. The effort applied on the bed is detected by a sensor on our device that runs the motor accordingly such as an electric bicycle. Our technology release the pain of the operator due to repetitive strain movement. In the case of a strecher, it releases joint pain, decrease fatigue and allows better driveability without changings habits. For the hospital, it adresses the optimization of the patient transport flow and improves the production in terms of transport per day.

WasteAnt GmbH,"The challenges that waste-to-energy plants face every day are diverse and require innovative solutions. There is no automatic system that can analyze high-volume material flows in real time for characteristics and ingredients. Hidden impurities can lead to drop chute blockages, and a lack of homogenization can lead to calorific value anomalies. WasteAnt offers sensor-based, AI-powered quality analysis for large-volume, unstructured waste streams. This creates a completely new level of transparency over waste streams, enabling waste management companies to make proactive decisions about waste treatment. By using various types of sensors in combination with system and ERP data, impurities can be identified, waste classification codes can be validated, characteristics such as homogeneity, chunkiness, dustiness and temperature can be evaluated, or calorific value and emission estimates can be created.",https://wasteant.com/,BREMEN,,"FUNDING, TALENTS",,https://vivatechnology.com/partners/wasteant-gmbh,https://storageprdv2inwink.blob.core.windows.net/1a2965b3-2132-40f9-983f-3f92a35743fe/3ae42dad-3633-426b-9589-a0274e68c4151,Artificial Intelligence,DeepTech,Energy
