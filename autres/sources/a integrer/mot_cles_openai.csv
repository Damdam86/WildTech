FLOATING GENES,"Floating Genes develops in vitro diagnostic kits for the early detection and monitoring of cancers in liquid biopsies (blood samples). Its technology allows highly sensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA by high-throughput sequencing (Next Generation Sequencing or NGS) at low sequencing depth. It is based on the selective amplification of mutant DNA and the correction of sequencing biais. Detecting actionable mutations can increase cancer survival by a factor of 9, helping clinicians identify cancer cases, guiding them in their treatment choices, and increasing survival by detecting relapses earlier. The company focuses on pancreatic cancer (PDAC), which kills 15,000 patients in France each year and has a median survival of 4 months. When detected and managed at an early stage, patients with this cancer can escape this very poor prognosis thanks to tumor resection.",https://storageprdv2inwink.blob.core.windows.net/1a2965b3-2132-40f9-983f-3f92a35743fe/2c9a7cf6-2846-4a71-aea2-aeb281f95d981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['https://vivatechnology.com/partners/www.floating-genes.com'],IVRY SUR SEINE

MAD,"Our mission at MAD is to revolutionise the climbing industry by addressing its environmental impact through bio-based materials and circularity. Despite climbers' deep respect for nature, the industry generates significant amounts of plastic waste annually, contributing to environmental degradation. Our pilot project focuses on climbing holds made from mycelium, the roots of mushrooms, which, combined with an organic substrate, acts as a binder and creates a lightweight, strong, renewable, and biodegradable material. This allows us to replace conventional plastic used in climbing holds. Additionally, our business model incorporates circularity by implementing a leasing system for the climbing holds, enabling us to refurbish and reintroduce them into the cycle. At the end of their lifespan, we can repurpose them as soil fertilisers, ensuring a sustainable approach from production to disposal.",https://storageprdv2inwink.blob.core.windows.net/1a2965b3-2132-40f9-983f-3f92a35743fe/03e3cd92-dcbe-4983-ae6f-5cc7dd27961e1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['https://vivatechnology.com/partners/www.wearenotmad.com'],BERLIN

MS,"I am developing an innovative startup that offers a non-intrusive centralized control solution for existing tertiary buildings' air conditioners. Our aim is to help companies optimize energy consumption, deal with increasing electricity costs, and comply with regulations. Currently, only 8 to 10% of French buildings have centralized management systems, mostly for new constructions. My solution requires no infrastructure modifications and consists of a central monitor controlling up to 200 connected remote controls. Each remote control receives setpoints from the monitor to transmit to the air conditioner. The application enables automatic scenario creation, air conditioner grouping, and data feedback access.

In particular, Si, has been attracting attention as a high-capacity anode material since it can react with 4 or more electrons, leading the significantly large capacity up to 4000 Ah/kg. However, Si has hardly been used because it has a large irreversible capacity, and a large volume change due to a charge/discharge reaction. ORLIB has developed the pressurized pre-doping technology to reduce irreversible capacity and the volume changes. Pre-doped Si, pSi, can be combined with various LIB cathodes to increase the energy by more than 1.5 times, making it possible to create high-energy batteries with low cost and rare metal-free LFP comparable to high energy LMNC.
